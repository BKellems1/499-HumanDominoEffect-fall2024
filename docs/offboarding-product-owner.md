# Offboarding - For Product Owners

[Back to index](index.md)

## Finalizing work for semester

Once the final presentation has concluded and the team has uploaded their final code for the semester, it would be ideal to walk through all the changes made during the work period. It would also be ideal to compare the work done against the Trello board to make sure all work cards are where they are supposed to be.

### Team clenaup

Over the semester, the team likely has outstanding pull requests, repository branches, or other work items that should be dealt with before they finish the semester. Make sure the team looks through the repository to make sure the next team will be working with as clean a slate as possible.

The team might have some work they would like to pass on to the next team. In this case it would be worth having the team document this somewhere (be it new work items in Trello, documented here in the repository, or noted by hand) for the product owner(s) to pass on to the next team. The product owners should also try and work with both teams to make sure that this transition of work is as seamless as possible.
