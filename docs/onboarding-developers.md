## Trello

Trello is a kanban board where user stories, bugs, and other features are stored. This is where developers will design, plan, and organize work items.

There will likely be existing work items in the `backlog` and `ready for sprint` columns. It's the developer's responsibility to talk with the product owner to determine what should take priority. Although, any bugs in these columns are good ways to get acquainted with the codebase.
