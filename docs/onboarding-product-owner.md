# Onboarding - For Product Owners

[Back to index](index.md)

## Your new team

As a product owner, it will be your responsibility to communicate your wishes for the project. While this will be a two way conversation, ultimately, the product owner is able to set goals and prioritize them as needed.

It will be your new team's responsiblity to communicate their strengths, limitations and ideas for goals outlined by the product owner.

## Introducing Trello

Trello is a kanban board where user stories, bugs, and features are stored. This is where developers will design, plan, and organize work items.

There will likely be existing work items in the `backlog` and `ready for sprint` columns. It's the developer's responsibility to talk with the product owner to determine what should take priority.

_While it isn't required_, it is strongly recommended for the product owner to somewhat regularly check this board to see if developers are focusing on what's expected and ask questions if they have any.

## Adding users to the Github Organization

This is a similar proccess to adding members to the Trello board. However, members _must_ have a github account.

First, nagivate to the [Human Domino Effect github organization](https://github.com/Human-Domino-Effect) and click on the `people` tab.

![People tab](/docs/assets/2023-04-21%2017_18_39-Human-Domino-Effect%20and%204%20more%20pages%20-%20Personal%20-%20Microsoft​%20Edge.png)

Once on the `people` tab, you should see an `invite member` button. Click this and a small window should appear.

![Invite member](/docs/assets/2023-04-21%2017_16_57-People%20·%20Human-Domino-Effect%20and%204%20more%20pages%20-%20Personal%20-%20Microsoft​%20Edge.png)

In this window, input the new member's email in the box. Their username should appear. Click on this.

_Make sure they are being invited as a member._ This will prevent developers from having too much access to the organization.

Once their email is input, you can click the `invite` button. Repeat this for all members.
